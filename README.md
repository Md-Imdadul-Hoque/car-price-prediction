# Price Prediction in E-Commerce

Language: Python
Notebook: Jupyter Notebook(Run by cmd)


Project details : The main objective of this project is to handle, explore, analyze the natural-language (English) data and predict the price of the products for an e-commerce named 'Mercari'. The problem statement is as follows and copied directly from Kaggle. In this project, my tutor Sadat shahriar guided me a lot and he is now phd student in an American university. Product pricing gets harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs. Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.


What is the task?
The task is to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. We were provided with user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.


What action did I take?
To predict the price, I had to tackle the problem following the standard data science pipelines. I cleaned the noisy data, analyze them, visualized the distribution when necessary, performed feaure engineering, and cross validated the performance using different machine learning algorithms. The actions were well described and demonstrated in the codes.
